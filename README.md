# crossUserMedia #

crossUserMedia demonstrates how to use the HTML5 getUserMedia control and the Flash Microphone object for a cross browser audio file recorder.
The demo allows a user to record themselves using the microphone from a browser session, post to a server, and play back the sound as an mp4 encoded file.

Inspired the work of [Thibault Imbert](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/author_bios/thibault_imbert.html) on capturing microphone audio in [JavaScript](http://typedarray.org/from-microphone-to-wav-to-server/) and [ActionScript](http://www.bytearray.org/?p=1858)
